### ðŸ“‹ **2. System Block Diagram**

#### **Figure 2.1 Block Diagram**
![blockdiagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d93b81c-ad1b-4b13-8a61-4f4aaf92fce7)



Figure 2.1 illustrates an IoT-enabled payment gateway system designed for a product vending or action-triggering device, such as a vending machine. At the core of this system lies the IoT microcontroller, which manages various components through its GPIO pins. The microcontroller interfaces with the user, a display unit, and a dispensing mechanism.

When a user interacts with the system, typically through buttons or other input devices, this triggers a series of events beginning with the display of a QR code on the display unit. The QR code serves as a prompt for the user to scan it using a mobile device, initiating the payment process.

The payment gateway, a crucial part of this setup, manages the transaction, ensuring that the payment is secure and verified. Once the user completes the payment, the gateway communicates the transaction details to a cloud platform. This platform acts as a bridge, storing the payment information and sending updates to the IoT microcontroller. The communication between the cloud platform and the microcontroller occurs over the internet, facilitated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that ensures real-time connectivity.

Upon receiving confirmation of successful payment from the cloud platform, the IoT microcontroller activates the dispensing mechanism, releasing the selected product or triggering a specified action. If the payment fails, the system will remain inactive for a certain period, giving the user time to attempt the payment again. During this waiting period, no product will be dispensed, and the display will not show any feedback. If the payment is not successfully processed within the specified time frame, the system will reset, returning to its initial state and awaiting further input from the user. This ensures that the process remains secure, automated, and the system is ready for a new transaction attempt.

#### 4.3 Successful Integration of the Components
In the development of a payment gateway on an IoT-enabled device for product dispensing or unlocking a service after payment, the ESP32 microcontroller plays a central role in managing and controlling the entire process. The setup of the ESP32 was carefully planned and implemented to ensure smooth operation across multiple components. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the ESP32 was set up:

1. Hardware Configuration:
   The ESP32 is equipped with built-in Wi-Fi, making it ideal for IoT-based applications. It was connected to peripheral components like the TFT Display, push buttons, buzzer, and the product dispensing mechanism. The GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins of the ESP32 were mapped to control each of these components. For example, specific pins were designated for reading input from the push buttons, triggering the product dispensing mechanism and driving the buzzer.

2. Wi-Fi Setup:
   Since the ESP32 needed to communicate with Google Firebase, establishing a stable Wi-Fi connection was a priority. The Wi-Fi libraries in the ESP32â€™s firmware were configured to connect to a secure network, allowing it to interact with the cloud-based Firebase database in real-time. This was achieved through simple Wi-Fi commands that enabled the ESP32 to send and receive data over the internet.

3. Firmware Development:
   The ESP32 was programmed using the Arduino IDE, with custom firmware developed to handle various tasks. This firmware was responsible for:
   â€¢ Reading user inputs from the push buttons.
   â€¢ Displaying the selected product and QR code on the TFT screen.
   â€¢ Establishing communication with Firebase for real-time payment verification using Razorpay as the main payment gateway.
   â€¢ Utilising Razorpayâ€™s webhook feature to send payment information to Firebase, where it is stored and monitored by the ESP32.
   â€¢ Triggering the product dispensing mechanism once the payment is confirmed as successful.
   â€¢ Providing audio feedback via the buzzer.

The code was structured to handle these tasks concurrently without interference, ensuring the system could process actions in real-time.

4. Cloud Communication:
   The ESP32â€™s firmware was integrated with Firebase using the Firebase ESP32 library, which enabled real-time synchronization of data such as transaction status and user actions. The ESP32 monitors the payment information from Firebase; if the payment is successful, it triggers the product dispensing action. If the payment fails, no action is taken.

5. Testing and Debugging:
   During the setup phase, the ESP32 was repeatedly tested to ensure reliable communication with both Firebase and Razorpay. Debugging tools in the Arduino IDE, along with serial print statements were employed to monitor data flow and troubleshoot any issues in communication or logic.

#### 4.4 Cashless Transaction Via Razorpay
The integration of Razorpay as the payment gateway enables the system to process secure, cashless transactions. Users are provided with a dynamic QR code on the TFT screen, linked to their selected product and payment amount. This QR code is scanned via mobile devices using UPI, simplifying the payment process. Once the payment is initiated, Razorpay ensures the transaction is securely processed, eliminating the need for physical currency handling. Additionally, integration with Google Firebase facilitates real-time communication between the ESP32 and Razorpay, ensuring that the system accurately verifies payments and reflects transaction status without delay. This results in a smooth, user-friendly payment process.

#### 4.5 Evidence of Payment Verification
A standout feature of the system is its ability to verify payments in real-time using Google Firebase as a cloud-based database. Firebase updates instantly once the transaction is complete, sending confirmation to the ESP32 microcontroller, which then triggers the product dispensing mechanism if the payment is successful. The entire process from payment to dispensing occurs within seconds, ensuring that users do not face unnecessary delays. This integration ensures that transactions are securely validated before any product is dispensed, preventing accidental or fraudulent dispensations.

##### 1. Successful Transaction Data
   For successful transactions, Firebase receives the transaction data and once the payment status is verified as successful, the system triggers the product dispensing action. Below figure 4.7 is a snapshot of the data retrieved from Firebase for a successful transaction:

   ![captured](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d34a51f-8704-4aca-8260-22bc3458bb76)
   


This data is retrieved in real-time by the ESP32 and used to trigger the product dispensing mechanism. When the payment status is captured as â€™payment.successâ€™, the payment is considered valid, and the dispensing action is triggered. This seamless payment verification process ensures that only successful payments lead to the dispensing of products, preventing any errors or fraudulent transactions.

##### 2. Failed Transaction Data
   For failed transactions, the data is captured and stored in Firebase which is shown in figure 4.8 below:
   #### **Figure 4.8: Payment Failed Status**

   ![failed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76390fe8-cd82-4f71-b81c-e36495a2de4a)


When the payment status is captured as â€™payment.failedâ€™, the system recognizes the transaction as unsuccessful. In this case, no dispensing action is triggered, ensuring that no product is dispensed without a valid payment. This process helps maintain the integrity and security of the system by preventing fraudulent or incomplete transactions.

#### 4.6 System Performance
The system demonstrates consistent and reliable performance throughout its operations. The Wi-Fi communication between the ESP32, Firebase and Razorpay is stable, ensuring that all components work in sync without any major connectivity issues. The delay between product selection, payment initiation and product dispensing is minimal, usually taking only a few seconds to complete all actions. This fast processing time enhances user satisfaction by ensuring that there are no long waits for transactions to complete. The systemâ€™s performance under various conditions, including multiple users and simultaneous transactions, proves its efficiency and scalability for practical use in automated vending machines or similar applications.
